<li>Information We Collect and How We Use It
    <div>We offer a number of services that do not require you to provide any personal information. However, in order to provide a full range of services, we may collect the following types of information from or about you:
        <ul>
        <li><span>Information You Provide</span> – When you sign up for a Pinsonault Associates' service that requires registration, we ask you for your name, email address, and an account password. For certain services, such as our Managed Market Summit, we also request credit card or other payment information, which we process in encrypted form on secure servers.</li>
        <li><span>Log Information</span> – When you access a Pinsonault Associates' Web site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a Web site. These server logs may include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. Pinsonault Associates generates cookies that reside in the users computer as well.</li>
        <li><span>User Communications</span> – When you send email or other communications to Pinsonault Associates, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, improve our services, and preserve a record of communications between you and Pinsonault Associates. </li>
        <li><span>Other Sites</span> – This Privacy Policy applies to Pinsonault Associates' services only. We do not exercise control over link sites that may be offered on our Web sites. These link sites may place cookies or other files on your computer, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. </li>
        <li><span>Supplemental Information</span> - In addition to the above types of information, Pinsonault Associates may seek additional information from you in connection with specific services that we may need in order to, for example, test and improve the technical operation of our network and develop new services. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</li>

<li>Information Security
    <div>
    We use commercially reasonable technical and personnel measures to protect personal information in our possession against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. 

    We restrict access to personal information to Pinsonault Associates' employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they violate their confidentiality obligations. 
    </div>
</li>
<li>Data Integrity
<div>
Pinsonault Associates processes personal information only for the purposes for which it is collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy or another privacy notice specific to a particular Pinsonault Associates' Web site or service. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information when necessary. 
</div>
</li>
<li>Accessing and Updating Personal Information 
<div>
Upon request, we will make a good faith effort to give you access to your personal information in order to correct or delete this information, unless we are required to retain any such information by law or this information is needed by Pinsonault Associates for a legitimate business purpose. We ask you to identify information that you desire to access, correct or remove before processing such requests. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require excessive technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impracticable (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes). In most cases, where we provide you with access to personal information, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
</div>
</li>
<li>Changes to This Privacy Policy
<div>Pinsonault Associates may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent, for we expect that most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes). </div>
</li>
<li>Policy Maintenance and Complaints
<div>Pinsonault Associates regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please feel free to direct any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, or Pinsonault’s treatment of personal information, by contacting us via this Web site or by writing to us at:
